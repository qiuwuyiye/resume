\datedsubsection{\faCheck\ {\textbf{Baidu FCR, Beijing, China}}  }{2015.05 -- 2015.08}
\role{Intern}{ Machine Learning Engineer}
Mainly Responsible for Model Evaluation, Feature Selection and Feature Investigation.
\begin{itemize}
%  \item Fcr-Model doen't have uniform feature analysis tools, and feature selection work is done completely by  independent assortment, so the process  is  far from efficiency. I developed a Feature evaluation tool based on the feature extraction system Adfea and model training system Platform to assist feature selection.
%  \item The online CPM prediction model for suggestion query(also called sug) is time-consuming, it can be greatly improved if time shrinkage strategy is utilized in the model. I do the experiment with half-year Baidu's suggestion query dataset to verify the model performance when the strategy is applied with different shrinkage factor and different time-window size.
%  \item Survey the CTR Prediction competition on Kaggle, and write a report about how winners processed the contiguous features, which model they have used and how they combine them.\end{itemize}

\item Developed a Feature evaluation tool based on the feature extraction system Adfea and model training system Platform to assist feature selection. With no uniform feature analysis tools beforehand, this work brings an end to independent assortment and thus remarkably raised the overall efficiency in FCR-Model.
\item Experimented with half-year Baidu’s suggestion query dataset to verify the model performance when the strategy is applied with different shrinkage factor and different time-window size. Time shrinkage strategy is widely utilized in the model to cut down the time consumption of the online CPM prediction model for suggestion query (i.e., sug). 
\item Developed a through report on the strategy of the CTR Prediction competition winners on Kaggle. Concerning data include the procession of contiguous features, model utilization and combination.

%\role{C, Python, Django, Linux}{Individual Projects, collaborated with xxx}
\role{Team Project}{Developer, Spark}
Consists of \href{http://bda.space:18080}{BDA Studio}(dragable machine learning platform) and BDA Lib(machine learning algorithm library).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed three graph algorithm (\href{http://bda.space:18080/BDAStudioMonitor.html?job=0000001-160229111630187-oozie-oozi-W}{Pagerank}, \href{http://bda.space:18080/BDAStudioMonitor.html?job=0000015-160229111630187-oozie-oozi-W}{ICmodel}, \href{http://bda.space:18080/BDAStudioMonitor.html?job=0000206-151222123224608-oozie-oozi-W}{KShell}), compared with intrinsic algorithms in spark graphx, they have several distinguishing features including fast convergence, scalability, and quickness.
  \item Implemented \href{http://bda.space:18080/BDAStudioMonitor.html?job=0000009-160229111630187-oozie-oozi-W}{Factorization Machine}  with local version, spark shared version, spark graphx version. Completed the Movie Rating task on MovieLens dataset from Netflix  with the algorithm and got a decent RMSE.
  \item Implemented \href{http://bda.space:18080/BDAStudioMonitor.html?job=0000009-160229111630187-oozie-oozi-W}{NMF}  with spark graphx which support model parallelizaztion instead of merely data parallelization. Carried out community detection in graph computing field and completed the Movie Rating task on MovieLens dataset from Netflix with the algorithm.
